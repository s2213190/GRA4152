# Implement a class ComboLock that works like the combination lock
# in a gym locker, as shown here. The lock is constructed with a
# combinationâ€”three numbers between 0 and 39. The reset method
# resets the dial so that it points to 0. The turnLeft and turnRight
# methods turn the dial by a given number of ticks to the left or
# right. The open method attempts to open the lock. The lock opens
# if the user first turned it right to the first number in the combination, then left to the second, and then right to the third.
# class ComboLock :
# def ComboLock(self, secret1, secret2, secret3) :

# def reset(self) :
# . . .
# def turnLeft(self, ticks) :
# . . .
# def turnRight(self, ticks) :
# . . .
# def open(self) :
# . . .

#### TESTING
Lock1 = ComboLock(1,2,3)
Lock1.reset()
Lock1.turnRight(39) 
Lock1.turnLeft(1)
Lock1.turnRight(39)
Lock1.Open() # Prints the lock is open as expected


print("****************************")

Lock2 = ComboLock(15,13,28)
Lock2.reset()
Lock2.turnRight(25) 
Lock2.turnLeft(78) # more than optimal rotations
Lock2.turnRight(25)
Lock2.Open() # Prints "ComboLock cannot be opened" despite matching secret key as the Dial Order does not match
